This is a quick overview on how to test USTM.py to make sure everything is working as intended
For a more detailed (but out-of-date) guide, please consult "USTM User Guide.docx" which describes what the user deals with
For a more detailed understanding of the insides of USTM, please see source code.

PAGE 1: BASIC
=============

Everything
----------
1. Set date/BoL/PAPS or use default values

2. Upload the ACE Manifest under "ACE Manifest"
ACE Manifest contains pretty much all the shipping data (eg. shipper, receiver, products, etc)
ACE Manifest is downloaded from techship > Orders > Manifest History > ("Download" Dropdown menu) > "Download ACE Manifest"
Sample document is "1-ACE.json" in /Test Files/

3. Upload the Detailed Report under "Detailed Report"
Contains all the batches/orders that have been scanned (confirmed on the truck) and the gaylord said package has been place in
Detailed Report is a template filled by user
Sample document is "2-Detailed_Report.xlsx" in /Test Files/

4. Upload the XLSX Report under "Report XLSX"
XLSX Report contains tracking numbers, carrier, client, etc, drastically simplifying the filtering process
XLSX Report is downloaded from techship > Orders > Manifest History > ("Download" Dropdown menu) > "Download report XLSX (50000 rows max)"
Sample document is "3-XLSX-Report.xlsx"

5. Click "Create Paperwork". USTM may give you 0-2 error boxes for the following:
	Unmatched Batch (Detailed Report lists an order that was not declared on the ACE manifest)
	Unmatched Entry (ACE manifest has an entry that does not match a scanned batch. Said entry is removed from the ACE manifest)
Any other errors are for technical errors (bad code, improperly entered data, missing files, etc)

USTM Should generate the following files in the folder specified by the "date" field (entered above):
	/date/[date]-ACE.json
		Should contain valid JSON shipping entries
	/date/[date]-Detailed_Report.csv
		Should be a spreadsheet of packages and their shipping data
	/date/[date]-IMS-BoL.pdf
		Should list number and breakdown of which gaylords are headed to FedEx/DHL
	/date/[date]-Load_Sheet.pdf
		Should list every gaylord that has an entry in the detailed report (aka. every gaylord shipping) along with which carrier, package count, and if the gaylord contains at least 1 FDA-regulated package
	/date/[date]-ProForma_Template.xlsx
		Should contain the same products* and amounts* you get if you download the Manifest Items report (techship > Reports > Manifest Items > enter in the Manifest Id)
		*Notes that USTM only counts products that are confirmed to have shipped for that day. On 90% of days (and thus 90% of sample data you can draw from) there should be no difference between the two (manifested and shipped). If a new product is added to the master FDA list make sure it ends up here when testing is done
	/date/[date]-Stalo-BoL.pdf
		Make sure date, BoL, PAPS, gaylord counts, package count are all there
	/date/[date]-USGR_Data.csv
		Used for customs purposes. Not essential. Contains all the US-manufactured products seen on the ProForma_Template

6. For testing purposes you can skip this step. Just upload any file that ends with .pdf
Upload ProForma template to SmartBorder (Proforma > Import Proformas (on the left bar) > Next > Drag and Drop. Ignore "No IncludesFreight" error > Import > View all Proformas > Select top-most Proforma. Validate > Save > Post to Broker > (wait) > Print. Upload the proforma in USTM

7. Click "Email Paperwork" and enter your outlook email username, then password
USTM will email everyone under the "emailRecipients" key in /resources/CONFIG.json with the 4 documents entered above
If there are any FedEx packages, this will also email the address listed under "fedexContact"

PAGE 2: ACE EDITING
===================

ACE Manifest:
-------------
Upload a valid ACE Manifest and click "Load ACE". Loading is successful if label reads "X entries loaded"

Gaylord Removal
---------------
After uploading an ACE, enter in the gaylord (eg. "G12") you would like to remove. Will report the amount of packages removed from the ACE. Also creates a file with all the removed orders whose filename ends with "-REMOVED_GAYLORDS"

Loops through all entries in the ACE and removes the ones where "GAYLORD" matches the entrybox

Batches/Order Removal
---------------------
After uploading an ACE, enter in the batches/orders (one per line, or split by commas) you would like to remove from the ACE Manifest. Will report the amount of packages removed from the ACE.  Also creates a file with all the removed orders whose filename ends with "-REMOVED_ORDERS"

Duplicate SCN Editor
--------------------
After uploading an ACE, enter in 2 digits (eg. 42) you would like to be the new ending of the 16-character long Shipment Control Numbers for all the entries in the ACE (The SCN consists of a 4-letter carrier code, 10 unique identifying digits, and finally 2 "empty" digits for this purpose)

Page 3: ADVANCED
================

Convert ACE to EXCEL
--------------------
Should convert an ACE to a CSV file, allowing for easy editing. All fields from the ACE should successfully be moved to the CSV.

Also converts a CSV back to JSON.

JSON Formatter
--------------
Literally reads the JSON and dumps it back out to the same file, but with indents.

JSON Combiner
-------------
Exactly what it says on the tin. Converts the JSON to 2 dictionaries, merges them, spits them back out.

Email Editing
-------------
Allows one to manually edit the first half of the email sent out. Default text is in /resources/CONFIG.json

PAGE 4: USGR
============
Creates a simple text-based spreadsheet of all FDA-regulated products that were manufactured in the US that are returning to the US. Then appends 6 forms with Entry number and date.
