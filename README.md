# USTruckManager

Version 2.0

-In-progress re-write of a good chunk of core logic to make it not complete spaghetti code

-Please see source code for a detailed walkthrough (and also the TODO list)

-Please see "Simplified Instructions.txt" for quickstart instructions (to test logic) or "USTruckManager User Guide.docx" (for the full user experience/requirements)

-Most end-user functionality has been maintained (alebit with some polish)

-Currently passes all tests with sample (old live) data

-USGR functionality is mostly irrelevant to core functions
